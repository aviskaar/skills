## 🌐 Vision

OpenOrg generalizes AI skills for enterprise automation, enabling fully autonomous organizations run by one person – scaling to unicorn status while prioritizing human good. By open-sourcing the skill layer, we give every builder the same leverage that once required entire departments.

---

## 🛠️ Core Features

- **🤖 Multi-AI model support** — Skills work across Claude, GPT, Gemini, and any model that accepts a system prompt.
- **🏢 Org-wide automation** — Pre-built hierarchies cover Research, Engineering, GTM, Marketing, and Operations end-to-end.
- **🔗 Composable skill stacks** — Orchestrator skills chain specialist skills, mirroring real team structures.
- **📦 Open-source extensibility** — Fork any skill, publish your own, and share across the community.
- **⚡ Agentic teams support** — Coordinate multi-agent pipelines using the [Agent Teams](AGENTS.md) model for parallel, autonomous execution.

**Skills** are portable packages of instructions, scripts, and resources that an AI agent loads dynamically to achieve deep, domain-specific expertise. Each skill follows the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), making them composable, version-controlled, and shareable.

---

## 🛠 What are Skills?

A skill lives in its own directory with a `SKILL.md` file at the root. This structure allows agents to understand both the high-level intent and the low-level execution details required for specialized tasks.

```text
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: instructions + metadata frontmatter
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable helpers
├── references/       # Optional: additional docs loaded on-demand
└── assets/           # Optional: static resources, templates, data

## 🚀 Using Skills

### Claude Code
Install directly into your project:
```bash
/plugin install aviskaar/open-org#research-paper-review
```

### Claude.ai
Upload any `SKILL.md` file into a **Claude.ai Project** to activate it for your conversation.

### API Usage
Inject skill instructions into the `system_prompt` or use the dedicated Skills API (where available).

---

## ✍️ Creating a Skill

Start from the [template](template/SKILL.md). A valid skill requires YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: "Use this skill when..."
metadata:
  author: your-name
  version: "1.0"
---

# Instructions
Detailed behavioral instructions go here.
```

**Best Practices:**
- **Trigger-focused:** Write descriptions as activation conditions.
- **Modular:** Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines; use `references/` for data.
- **Tooling:** Explicitly define `allowed-tools` if the skill requires environment access.

---
