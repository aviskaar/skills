# Prospect Research Guide

Deep-research playbook for building Prospect Intel Briefs before outreach and meetings.

## The 5-Minute Research Stack

Use this sequence for every prospect. The goal is to surface **one hyper-specific hook** in under 5 minutes for Silver-tier prospects, 10 minutes for Gold, and 20 minutes for Platinum.

### Step 1 — LinkedIn Profile Scan (2 min)

Open their LinkedIn profile and capture:

**About their role:**
- Current title and how long they've held it
  - < 6 months: new hire, likely trying to make an impact fast — they're open to change
  - 6–18 months: in execution mode — they care about results, not experiments
  - > 18 months: established — needs a compelling reason to change anything
- Previous companies and what they built there (tells you their decision-making bias)
- Education and certifications (sometimes relevant for consulting/services pitch)

**About their public activity:**
- Scroll their last 5 posts and comments
  - What topics do they write about? (reveals their priorities)
  - What frustrations do they express? (direct pain hooks)
  - What are they proud of? (use as an opener — "I saw your post about X")
- Articles they've published (gold mine for their worldview)
- Groups they belong to (community tells you what they care about)

**About their company context:**
- Their listed skills and endorsements (confirms what they own)
- Who they follow (reveals aspirational peers and industry influencers)
- Any recommendations given or received (style of relationship they value)

### Step 2 — Company Signal Hunt (2 min)

Search: `"{company name}" site:techcrunch.com OR site:businesswire.com OR site:prnewswire.com`
And separately: `"{company name}" funding OR product launch OR expansion 2025 OR 2026`

Look for:
- **Funding news**: New capital = new mandate, new spend, urgency to deploy
- **Leadership changes**: New CxO or VP = everything is up for re-evaluation
- **Product launches**: They're growing — what infrastructure are they adding?
- **Partnerships**: Who are they aligning with? (reveals tech stack and strategy)
- **Layoffs or restructuring**: Cost pressure = ROI story must be tight
- **Acquisitions**: Integration pain = massive opportunity for consulting/tooling

Also check their **Careers page** directly:
- Volume of open roles signals growth areas
- Job descriptions reveal the exact language their team uses (mirror it in outreach)
- A job posting for a role your product automates is a direct signal

---

### Step 3 — Tech Stack Scan (30 sec)

Visit `builtwith.com/[company-domain]` or check job postings for technology mentions.

Document:
- Tools they already use that your product integrates with (integration angle)
- Tools that are your direct competitors (displacement angle)
- Gaps where your product fits without a competitor present (greenfield angle)

---

### Step 4 — Industry Context (30 sec)

Search: `"{their industry}" challenges 2026` or `"{their industry}" trends 2026`

This tells you:
- What macro problems their peers are facing (you can reference "what we're hearing across your industry")
- Regulatory changes that create urgency
- Competitive dynamics they're likely navigating

## Buying Signal Interpretation Guide

### Signal: New VP or Director Hired in the Last 90 Days

**Why it matters**: New leaders are hired to change things. They have 90 days to establish credibility, a mandate to show results, and zero loyalty to their predecessor's vendor choices.

**How to use it in outreach**:
> "Congrats on the new role at [Company] — first 90 days in a new seat are when the biggest decisions get made. We've helped three VPs of [their function] in your space move quickly on [pain area] in their first quarter..."

**Qualification question in the meeting**: "What's the one thing you want to have proven out by the end of your first 90 days?"

---

### Signal: Company Just Raised Funding

**Why it matters**: New capital = new spending authority. The company is in growth mode and actively deploying budget on infrastructure, tooling, and headcount.

**How to use it in outreach**:
> "Saw the Series B announcement — impressive trajectory. When companies at [Company]'s stage scale from [X] to [Y], [specific pain] typically becomes the bottleneck. That's what we helped [similar company] solve right after their raise..."

**Qualification question**: "What parts of the business are you prioritizing with the new capital?"

---

### Signal: Actively Hiring for Roles Your Product Replaces

**Why it matters**: They're planning to solve the problem manually. A hire costs $150–300K/year fully loaded. Your product might solve it for $30K. The ROI case writes itself.

**How to use it in outreach**:
> "Noticed [Company] is hiring for [role]. Before you make that hire, worth a quick conversation — we've helped [customer] do exactly what that role was supposed to do, in half the time, without the headcount. 20 minutes?"

---

### Signal: Competitor Customer

**Why it matters**: They're already aware of the pain and already spending money. The question is whether their current solution is good enough.

**How to use it in outreach**:
> "Noticed [Company] is using [competitor]. Customers who've come to us from there consistently cite [specific gap or limitation]. Happy to show you what's different — even if it's not the right time, you'll have a useful benchmark for your next renewal."

---

### Signal: Recent Press Mentioning a Problem You Solve

**Why it matters**: They've publicly acknowledged the pain. This is the most powerful hook — you're referencing their own words.

**How to use it in outreach**:
> "Read the [article/interview] where [Name or CEO] mentioned [exact quote or paraphrase of pain]. That's exactly what [Company] was struggling with before [outcome]. I thought it was worth reaching out."

## Research Anti-Patterns (What Not to Do)

- **Don't research for more than 20 minutes on a single prospect.** Diminishing returns set in fast. Get the hook and start writing.
- **Don't use generic industry pain as a personalization hook.** "I know CFOs are focused on efficiency" is not personalization. "I saw your post about your team migrating off Snowflake" is.
- **Don't cite outdated signals.** A funding announcement from 2 years ago is not a trigger. A post from last week is.
- **Don't over-research before qualifying.** You don't need to know everything about a prospect before the first touch. Save the deep research for warm leads and pre-meeting prep.
- **Don't skip research for "fast" outreach.** The fastest path to a meeting is a personalized first touch. Generic outreach that gets no replies is not fast — it wastes the prospect relationship entirely.

## Pre-Meeting Research Protocol

When a meeting is booked, go deeper. Schedule 20 minutes of prep for every 30-minute meeting.

### Executive Meeting Prep Checklist

**About the prospect:**
- [ ] Read their last 10 LinkedIn posts/comments
- [ ] Find any public talks, podcasts, or articles they've been featured in
- [ ] Note their career trajectory — what have they built and shipped?
- [ ] Check if they've mentioned your company or competitors anywhere public

**About their company:**
- [ ] Last 3 press releases or earnings call summaries
- [ ] Their product's latest release notes or changelog (if relevant)
- [ ] Any analyst reports or G2/Gartner coverage of their space
- [ ] Current open roles (priority investments signal their roadmap)

**About the deal context:**
- [ ] Review all prior email/LinkedIn exchanges for any commitments or context
- [ ] Check CRM for any prior contact by other team members
- [ ] Confirm who else might be on the call (look up each person if unknown)

**Prepare three questions:**
1. A discovery question that surfaces the pain (open-ended, specific to their context)
2. A question about the decision process (who else is involved, timeline, budget cycle)
3. A question that positions your differentiation ("How are you thinking about [specific gap]?")
