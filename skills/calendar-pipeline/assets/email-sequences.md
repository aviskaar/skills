# Email Sequence Templates

Ready-to-use email sequences for product-based and consulting companies selling to VP, Director, and C-suite buyers. All templates require personalization — the brackets marked `[PERSONALIZE]` must be replaced with prospect-specific content before sending.

---

## How to Use These Templates

1. Select the sequence matching your ICP and your company type (product or consulting)
2. Replace all `[BRACKET]` fields — generic fields are fine to template, `[PERSONALIZE]` fields MUST be customized
3. Review against the SPEAR framework (references/messaging-playbook.md) before sending
4. Never send touch 2 before confirming touch 1 was delivered (check for bounces)

---

## Sequence A — Product Company, VP Engineering / CTO

**Use when**: Selling a developer tool, data infrastructure, platform, or DevOps product.

---

### Touch 1 — Day 1 (Email, First Touch)

**Subject**: `[PERSONALIZE: specific signal — e.g., "[Company]'s platform migration" or "scaling [Company]'s data stack"]`

```
Hi [First Name],

[PERSONALIZE: 1–2 sentences referencing a specific signal — recent hire, job posting, funding, press mention, or their LinkedIn post. Make it clear you looked at their actual situation.]

The pattern we see at companies at [Company]'s stage: [PERSONALIZE: specific pain that matches the signal — e.g., "the data infrastructure that worked at 20 engineers starts breaking at 80."]

We helped [Reference Customer — use a recognizable logo in their industry if possible] [specific, quantified outcome] in [timeframe]. Their [relevant title] said [brief quote or paraphrase if available].

Worth 20 minutes to see if this maps to what you're navigating?

[Your name]
```

### Touch 2 — Day 7 (Email, Follow-up #1)

**Subject**: `Re: [previous subject]`

```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note from last week.

One thing I didn't mention: [PERSONALIZE: add a new piece of value — a second proof point, a non-obvious insight about their industry, or a specific challenge their current tech stack creates.]

[If they have a specific tech stack signal]: Most teams running [known tool in their stack] hit [specific limitation] around [Company]'s scale. We built around that specifically.

Still happy to do a no-agenda 20 minutes. Are you the right person for this, or would [function] be better handled by someone else on your team?

[Your name]
```

---

### Touch 3 — Day 14 (Email, New Angle)

**Subject**: `[different angle — e.g., "the [specific metric] question" or "[Company] + [your integration partner]"]`

```
Hi [First Name],

One more try — different angle.

[PERSONALIZE: reframe around a second pain point or a specific business outcome rather than the technical problem. E.g., if touch 1 was about infrastructure, touch 3 is about business impact — time to market, incident cost, team velocity.]

[Customer 2 or different outcome from Customer 1]: [specific result].

If this isn't the right time or I've got the wrong person, just let me know and I'll point my energy elsewhere. Otherwise — 20 minutes Thursday or Friday?

[Your name]
```

---

### Touch 4 — Day 21 (Email, Breakup)

**Subject**: `Re: [original subject]`

```
Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times — I'll take the hint and stop following up.

If [specific pain] ever becomes a priority at [Company], we're easy to find. We'll keep [specific outcome we deliver] on the shelf for you.

Best of luck with [PERSONALIZE: specific company initiative — product launch, migration, expansion].

[Your name]
```

*(Note: This email consistently gets 15–25% reply rates from prospects who ignored the previous 3. The key is the specific callout at the end.)*

---

## Sequence B — Product Company, VP Product / Head of Product

**Use when**: Selling product analytics, roadmapping, customer feedback, research, or experimentation tools.

---

### Touch 1 — Day 1

**Subject**: `[PERSONALIZE: e.g., "product velocity at [Company]" or "Re: your post on [topic]"]`

```
Hi [First Name],

[PERSONALIZE: reference their recent LinkedIn activity, a product launch, a job posting for a PM role, or a blog post they published. One specific, relevant observation.]

Product teams at [Company]'s stage tend to hit a specific wall: [PERSONALIZE: specific pain — e.g., "the gap between what engineering ships and what users actually want grows faster than the roadmap can close."]

[Customer] — a [company type + stage similar to prospect] — used [product] to [specific outcome]. Their Head of Product said it was the first time the roadmap felt defensible to the board.

20 minutes to see if it's relevant for you?

[Your name]
```

---

### Touch 2 — Day 7

**Subject**: `Re: [previous subject]`

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up.

[PERSONALIZE: share a non-obvious insight — a data point about teams at their stage, a framework for prioritization, or a trend you're seeing across product teams in their vertical.]

The reason I'm reaching out specifically now: [PERSONALIZE: the specific signal that makes this the right time].

Still think it's worth 20 minutes. You pick the time.

[Your name]
```

---

### Touch 3 — Day 14

**Subject**: `[Company]'s product-engineering alignment`

```
Hi [First Name],

Last note — different lens.

The companies we work with that get the most value aren't just solving a tooling problem — they're solving a communication problem between product and engineering. [specific way your product addresses the communication gap].

[Customer 2]: [result framed as an alignment win, not just a tool win].

If that's not the challenge at [Company] right now, no worries — I'll stop here. Otherwise: Thursday or Friday work for a quick 20 minutes?

[Your name]
```

---

## Sequence C — Consulting Company, C-Suite (CEO, COO, CFO)

**Use when**: Selling strategic consulting, digital transformation, organizational design, or financial advisory to the C-suite.

---

### Touch 1 — Day 1

**Subject**: `[PERSONALIZE: insight-first — a specific observation about their company or industry, not about you]`

```
Hi [First Name],

[PERSONALIZE: 2 sentences demonstrating you've done your homework — their company's strategic direction, a specific challenge their industry is navigating, or something specific from their public statements. This is where consulting outreach differs from product: you lead with your perspective, not their problem.]

We've been working closely with [3–4 companies in their vertical or at their stage] on exactly this. The pattern that separates the ones who navigate [challenge] well from those who get stuck is [specific, non-obvious insight — not generic consulting speak].

I'd like to share what we're seeing — no agenda beyond that. Do you have 20 minutes in the next couple of weeks?

[Your name]
[Title + Company]
```

---

### Touch 2 — Day 10

**Subject**: `Re: [previous subject]`

```
Hi [First Name],

Following up briefly.

One thing I wanted to add: [PERSONALIZE: a specific, relevant data point, a recent industry development, or a second piece of perspective that advances the conversation. In consulting, follow-ups add intellectual value, not just "bumping this to the top of your inbox."]

[Reference Customer]: [specific engagement outcome — e.g., "reduced their integration timeline from 18 months to 7" or "identified $12M in operational cost they had no visibility into."]

Happy to share how that worked if it's useful context. 20 minutes?

[Your name]
```

---

### Touch 3 — Day 18

**Subject**: `[Company]'s [specific challenge] — a different frame`

```
Hi [First Name],

One more reach-out — and I'll keep it short.

The framing I should have led with: [PERSONALIZE: reframe around a business outcome, not the consulting engagement itself. C-suite buyers care about business results, not consulting methodology. What specific, measurable thing will be different after working together?]

[Concise case study — one sentence challenge, one sentence outcome.]

If the timing is off, I understand. If it's not — are you the right person to start a conversation, or would [CFO / COO / Division President] be a better fit?

[Your name]
```

---

### Touch 4 — Day 21 (Breakup)

**Subject**: `Re: [original subject]`

```
Hi [First Name],

Last note — I'll leave you alone after this.

We've helped [2–3 names or company types] navigate [challenge] over the past [X] years. If [Company]'s priorities shift and this becomes relevant, we're easy to find.

Best of luck with [PERSONALIZE: specific strategic initiative you know about].

[Your name]
```

---

## Sequence D — Re-engagement (Prospects Who Went Dark 60–90+ Days Ago)

**Use when**: A prospect previously engaged (replied, booked a meeting, or attended a demo) but the conversation stalled.

---

### Touch 1 — Re-engagement

**Subject**: `[PERSONALIZE: a specific new trigger — funding, news, new hire, or industry development since you last spoke]`

```
Hi [First Name],

We spoke [month/quarter] about [brief context — 5 words max]. Timing wasn't right.

[PERSONALIZE: 1–2 sentences on what's changed since then — at their company, in their industry, or in your product/offering. This is why now is different from then.]

Worth reconnecting for 20 minutes to see if the timing is better?

[Your name]
```

---

### Touch 2 — Day 7 (Re-engagement follow-up)

**Subject**: `Re: [previous subject]`

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up on my note last week.

[PERSONALIZE: add one new piece of value — a relevant customer result, a new capability, or a specific insight relevant to their current situation.]

No pressure — just wanted to make sure this landed. Happy to reconnect whenever the timing makes sense.

[Your name]
```

---

## Calendar Booking Email (Post-Interest Reply)

**Send within 5 minutes of receiving an interested reply.**

```
Hi [First Name],

Great — glad the timing works.

Here are three slots that work on my end:
- [Day, Date] at [Time] [Timezone]
- [Day, Date] at [Time] [Timezone]
- [Day, Date] at [Time] [Timezone]

If none of those work, here's my calendar link: [link]

I'll send a confirmed invite with a quick agenda once we lock it in.

[Your name]
```

---

## Meeting Confirmation Email

**Send immediately after the meeting is booked, at least 24 hours before the meeting.**

```
Subject: Confirmed: [Your Name] / [Their Name] — [Day, Date] at [Time] [Timezone]

Hi [First Name],

Looking forward to our conversation on [Day, Date] at [Time] [Timezone].

Quick agenda:

2. [15 min] Walk through how we helped [reference customer] [specific outcome]
3. [10 min] Q&A — and next steps if it seems like a fit

Let me know if anything changes before then.

[Your name]
