# LinkedIn Outreach Sequences

Templates and playbooks for LinkedIn-based outreach to VP, Director, and C-suite buyers. LinkedIn typically converts 30–50% better than cold email for senior buyers when executed correctly — because it feels like a professional conversation, not a sales pitch.

## LinkedIn Outreach Principles

### Before You Message Anyone

1. **Warm before you DM.** Like and leave a substantive comment on their last 2 posts *before* sending a connection request. This puts your name in their notifications and makes your request feel like a continuation of a conversation, not a cold approach.

2. **Your profile is your first impression.** Before any outreach, ensure:
   - Profile photo is professional and approachable
   - Headline speaks to the outcome you deliver, not just your title
   - About section tells a story from the buyer's perspective ("I help VPs of Engineering...")
   - Recent posts show you think deeply about their world (not just company news)

3. **Never pitch in the connection request.** The connection request note exists to get accepted — not to sell. Use it to create curiosity or reference a shared context.

4. **DM only after connection is accepted.** Sending a DM before connecting (InMail) converts at roughly 50% of the rate of a DM to an accepted connection.

## The LinkedIn Sequence (9-touch, 21 days)

```
Day 1   → Engage: Like their most recent post
Day 2   → Engage: Comment substantively on a second post
Day 3   → Connection Request (with note)
Day 5   → Wait for acceptance; if accepted, proceed to Day 7
Day 7   → First DM (first touch)
Day 10  → DM Follow-up #1 (if no reply)
Day 14  → Engage again: comment on a new post they made
Day 16  → DM Follow-up #2 (new angle)
Day 21  → Final DM (breakup)
```

If they don't accept the connection request within 7 days, move to email-first approach and use LinkedIn as a parallel channel only.

## Engagement Templates (Pre-Connection)

### Comment Formula

A good LinkedIn comment on an executive's post does three things:
1. Validates or extends their point (never disagrees publicly)
2. Adds something specific — a data point, an example, a follow-on question
3. Signals your expertise without pitching

**Template:**
> "[Affirm their point in 5 words] — [extend it with your own specific insight or example]. [Optional: ask a single genuine question that invites a response.]"

**Example:**
> "Exactly what we see across engineering orgs at scale — the complexity compounds faster than the process catches up. Curious: how are you thinking about the tooling layer vs. the organizational design layer?"

**What not to comment:**
- "Great post!" (lazy, invisible)
- "Couldn't agree more!" (no value added)
- Anything that promotes your product or company
- A long comment that makes it about you, not them

## Connection Request Notes

250 characters maximum. Get accepted, not pitched.

### Formula Options

**Option 1 — Content engagement hook:**
> "Your post on [specific topic] made me think differently about [specific aspect]. Wanted to connect with folks thinking carefully about this space."

**Option 2 — Shared signal/context:**
> "Noticed [Company] just [funding/launch/initiative] — working in this space and would value the connection. No agenda beyond that."

**Option 3 — Mutual connection (strongest):**
> "[Mutual connection] mentioned you as someone worth knowing in [relevant area]. Hope it's okay to reach out directly."

**Option 4 — Industry insight hook:**
> "Doing research on how [role type] at [industry/stage] companies are approaching [specific challenge]. Your experience seems directly relevant — would appreciate the connection."

**What never works in connection requests:**
- "Hi [Name], I work at [Company] and we help companies like yours..."
- Any mention of a product, demo, or meeting
- More than 2 sentences

## First DM Templates

Send within 24 hours of connection acceptance. Keep it under 300 characters — most LinkedIn DMs are read on mobile.

### Template 1 — Signal-Based (Recommended)

```
Hi [First Name] — thanks for connecting.

[PERSONALIZE: 1 specific sentence referencing a signal — their post, company news, or job posting. 20 words max.]

We helped [reference customer] [specific outcome] on exactly this. Worth a 20-minute chat to see if it translates to [Company]?
```

*(Total: ~200 characters — fits on a mobile screen without scrolling)*

---

### Template 2 — Content Bridge

**Use after commenting on their post:**

```
Hi [First Name] — appreciate you sharing your thinking on [topic from their post].

We're working on the same problem from the vendor side — helped [customer] [outcome] recently.

Would you be open to 20 minutes to compare notes?
```

---

### Template 3 — Consulting/Advisory Framing

**Use for consulting companies or when selling to C-suite:**

```
Hi [First Name],

[PERSONALIZE: 1-sentence observation about what [Company] is navigating right now — not about you.]

Working with [2–3 similar companies] on this. Happy to share what we're seeing — no agenda. 20 minutes?
```

---

## Follow-Up DM Templates

### Follow-Up #1 — Day 10 (Add New Value)

```
Hi [First Name] — following up on my note from last week.

[PERSONALIZE: new piece of value — an insight, a relevant customer story, or a question about their specific situation.]

Still think it could be worth 20 minutes. You pick the time.
```

---

### Follow-Up #2 — Day 16 (New Angle, After Engaging Again)

After commenting on another one of their posts between Day 14-16, send:

```
Hi [First Name],

[Optional reference to your recent comment: "Enjoyed the post on [topic]."]

Different angle from my earlier notes: [PERSONALIZE: reframe around a business outcome or a different pain point than your first touch.]

Worth a quick conversation?
```

---

### Final DM — Day 21 (Graceful Breakup)

```
Hi [First Name] — last note, promise.

Reached out a few times and totally understand if the timing is off.

If [specific challenge] ever moves up the priority list at [Company], happy to reconnect. Until then, good luck with [PERSONALIZE: specific initiative].
```

---

## Voicemail Script (After LinkedIn + Email Sequence, No Reply)

Use phone only after 2+ digital touches with no response. Leave a voicemail — never hang up.

**Duration target**: 25–30 seconds. Practice until it sounds natural.

```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company].

I've sent you a couple of notes about [1 sentence on the specific problem — not your product].

Wanted to put a voice to the name. I'll send you a follow-up email right after this with one specific example — [Customer]'s result — that I think will make the 20-minute conversation worth it.

You can reach me at [phone number]. Talk soon."
```

**Follow immediately with an email referencing the voicemail:**
> "Just left you a voicemail — sending the follow-up I mentioned. [Paste the email follow-up here.]"

## LinkedIn Engagement Playbook for Warm Accounts

For your top 20 strategic accounts, use LinkedIn to stay visible and build relationship *before* you need something.

### The Warm Account Weekly Routine (10 min/week per account)

1. **Monday**: Check if the prospect or their colleagues posted anything in the last 7 days
2. **If they posted**: Leave a substantive comment (2–3 sentences, adds genuine insight)
3. **If they haven't**: Like or share a relevant piece of industry content and tag them: "Thought of you given what [Company] is doing with [initiative]"
4. **Monthly**: Send a DM sharing a relevant insight, article, or customer story with zero ask: "No agenda — thought this might be useful given [their situation]."

After 2–3 months of consistent, non-pushy engagement:
- The prospect knows your name and associates it with expertise, not sales pressure
- Your eventual ask for a meeting feels like a natural next step, not a cold approach
- Conversion rate on the eventual ask is 3–5× higher than cold outreach

---

## LinkedIn InMail (When Not Connected)

Use InMail sparingly — it's expensive and converts at half the rate of DMs to accepted connections.

**When to use InMail:**
- Platinum-tier prospects who haven't accepted your connection request after 7 days
- Senior C-suite where the connection approach might feel presumptuous

**InMail subject line rules (same as email subject lines):**
- Under 7 words
- Specific to their company or role
- No promotional language

**InMail body**: Same as First DM template, but can be slightly longer (up to 400 characters). Always include a specific hook — generic InMail is immediately deleted.

## Response Handling on LinkedIn

| Response | Immediate Action |
|----------|-----------------|
| "Interested, let's talk" | Reply within 5 min with 3 calendar slots OR your scheduling link |
| "Not now, but maybe Q3" | Reply with gratitude, note in CRM with Q3 reminder, stay engaged on their content |
| "Not the right person, talk to [X]" | Ask for an intro: "Would you be willing to make a quick introduction?" |
| "Can you send more info?" | Send one specific piece — a relevant case study or a 2-minute video, not a product brochure |
| No reply | Follow the sequence — advance to the next touch after the scheduled delay |
| Remove/Disconnect | Suppress from all outreach, note in CRM |

---

## Platform-Specific Notes

### LinkedIn Sales Navigator (Recommended for serious volume)

With Sales Navigator:
- Set up saved searches for your ICP (filter by title, company size, industry, seniority, years in role)
- Enable alerts for: new VPs/Directors, company growth signals, job changes at target accounts
- Track account activity: news alerts, personnel changes, headcount trends
- Use the "TeamLink" feature to surface mutual connections for warm introduction requests

### Free LinkedIn (Limited but usable)

Without Sales Navigator:
- Use boolean search: `"VP Engineering" AND "Series B" AND "fintech"` in the LinkedIn search bar
- Check the "People Also Viewed" section on target prospect profiles to find similar buyers
- Use LinkedIn's "Alumni" filter to find prospects who went to the same school as someone on your team
- Search for posts using relevant keywords to find active voices in your target market
