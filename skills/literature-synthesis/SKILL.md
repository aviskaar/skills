# Literature Synthesis

Synthesize findings across a set of research papers into a coherent, structured overview.

## Process

### Step 1 — Scope
Clarify the exact research question or topic. If not provided, ask before proceeding.

### Step 2 — Organize Sources
Group papers by:
- Methodology (e.g., empirical vs. theoretical, supervised vs. unsupervised)
- Chronology (identify how the field evolved)
- Findings (consensus vs. conflicting results)

### Step 3 — Write the Synthesis

Structure the output as follows:

#### Background
One paragraph establishing why this topic matters and what preceded it.

#### Key Themes
For each major theme or line of work:
- Describe the approach
- Cite representative papers
- State what was established and what remains uncertain

#### Points of Consensus
What the field broadly agrees on, with supporting citations.

#### Open Debates
Where papers meaningfully contradict each other — describe each position fairly.

#### Open Problems
Research questions that remain unanswered or underexplored.

#### Synthesis Conclusion
A 2–3 sentence takeaway: what the body of work tells us and what the most promising next step is.

## Citation Style

Use inline parenthetical citations: (Author et al., Year). List full references at the end.

## Tone

Write as a neutral analyst, not an advocate. Present conflicting views without taking sides unless the evidence is overwhelming.
