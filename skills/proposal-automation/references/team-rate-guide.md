## Offshore Location Rate Tiers

Offshore rates vary by geography. Apply appropriate multiplier:

| Tier | Countries | Rate Range (vs. table) |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 (Near-shore) | Canada, Mexico, Eastern Europe (Poland, Romania, Czech) | +20–35% vs table |
| Tier 2 (Mid-shore) | India (Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune), Philippines, Vietnam | Table rates as shown |
| Tier 3 (Deep offshore) | India (Tier-2 cities), Pakistan, Bangladesh | −10–20% vs table |

**Note**: Tier 1 near-shore trades cost savings for timezone overlap and lower coordination overhead.

---

## Blended Rate Calculation

For a mixed US + offshore team, calculate blended rate per role:

```
Blended Rate = (US_rate × US_FTE_ratio) + (Offshore_rate × Offshore_FTE_ratio)

Example — Backend Engineer (70% offshore, 30% US):
  = ($150 × 0.30) + ($45 × 0.70)
  = $45 + $31.50
  = $76.50/hr blended
```

**Standard blended ratios by model**:

| Team Model | US % | Offshore % |
|---|---|---|
| US Onshore | 100% | 0% |
| Blended (recommended) | 30–40% | 60–70% |
| Offshore-Led | 10–15% | 85–90% |

---

## Hours Per Week & Utilization

| Type | Hours/Week | Utilization |
|---|---|---|
| Full-time billed | 40 hrs/week | 85–90% (account for meetings, overhead) |
| Part-time (0.5 FTE) | 20 hrs/week | — |
| Senior oversight (0.25 FTE) | 10 hrs/week | — |

For cost calculations:

```
Billable hours = FTE_ratio × weeks × 40 hrs × 0.875 (effective utilization)
Cost = Billable hours × Rate
```

Use 0.875 (87.5%) utilization as standard. Adjust to 0.80 for highly collaborative/meeting-heavy phases (e.g., discovery, UAT).

---

## Vendor / Subcontractor Markup

If using a staffing vendor or subcontractor rather than direct employees:

| Scenario | Markup |
|---|---|
| Direct hire / FTE | 0% markup; apply burden rate (benefits: +25–30% of salary) |
| Staff augmentation vendor | +15–25% on top of the rates above |
| Big-4 / tier-1 SI | Add 40–60% premium (use as market comparison only) |

## Annual Salary Benchmarks (Internal Reference)

For converting between hourly rates and annual salaries (useful when customer asks about FTE hiring costs):

| Role | US Annual Salary | Offshore Annual Salary |
|---|---|---|
| Solutions Architect (Sr) | $180,000–$230,000 | $40,000–$65,000 |
| Tech Lead (Sr) | $170,000–$220,000 | $35,000–$55,000 |
| Senior Backend Engineer | $150,000–$190,000 | $28,000–$45,000 |
| Mid Backend Engineer | $120,000–$155,000 | $18,000–$30,000 |
| Senior ML Engineer | $180,000–$250,000 | $35,000–$55,000 |
| Senior Data Engineer | $155,000–$200,000 | $28,000–$48,000 |
| Senior DevOps/SRE | $155,000–$200,000 | $30,000–$50,000 |

**Rule of thumb**: Hourly consulting rate ≈ Annual salary ÷ 1,000
(Example: $180K salary → ~$180/hr consulting rate, which captures overhead + margin)
